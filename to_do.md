## To do:

- [ ] Take notes 
- [ ] Draft project structure (in detail)
- [ ] Create pre-gitignore
- [ ] Write main and input validation functions 
- [ ] Write 'rules' secction
- [ ] Find out how to include libft + on the Makefile
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] REPLACE 'write' with 'ft_printf'!!!!
- [ ] Validation does not allow a combination of numeric strings and wtspc strings
- [ ] Validation shouldn't allow repeated nums
---

## Take notes on:

- [ ] Big O Notation
- [ ] Algorithm types
- [ ] More details on the chosen algorithm

---

## Final checks:

- [ ] Norm check
- [ ] Search unwanted files

---

## Rules
- [ ] Must have Makefile (it must not relink)
- [ ] The first argument should be at the top of the stack
- [ ] must display the shortest sequence of instructions needed to sort stack
      a with the smallest number at the top
- [ ] Instructions must be separated by a ’\n’ and nothing else
- [ ] If no parameters are specified, the program simply returns
- [ ] In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by an ’\n’ on the standard error

---

## Questions:

- Can I really have my subdirectories?
- How do I include libft and ft_printf?
