## To do next:

- [ ] Write free_stack()
- [ ] Test list-related + new validation functions
- [ ] New main

## To do later:

- [ ] HEADERS!! Check libft functions for missing headers too!
- [ ] Replace safe_aotoi with ft_atol + check for int limits
- [X] Replace tokens_to_tab with tokens_to_stack (linked list)
- [X] Add check for repeated nums in validation
- [X] Replace libft strjoin with piscine's strjoin + same for ft_split(??)
- [ ] Test validation better!!!
- [ ] Check for unused files and functions, nice repo cleanup
- [X] Redo validation (first, parse av to tokens, then validate each token)
- [X] Take notes 
- [X] Create pre-gitignore
- [X] Write main and input validation functions 
- [ ] Write 'rules' secction
- [X] Find out how to include libft + on the Makefile
- [X] Makefile
 
---

## Take notes on:

- [X] Each operation
- [ ] Big O Notation
- [ ] Algorithm types
- [ ] More details on the chosen algorithm

---

## Final checks:

- [ ] Norm check
- [ ] Search unwanted files

---

## Rules
- [X] Must have Makefile (it must not relink)
- [ ] The first argument should be at the top of the stack
- [ ] must display the shortest sequence of instructions needed to sort stack
      a with the smallest number at the top
- [ ] Instructions must be separated by a ’\n’ and nothing else
- [ ] If no parameters are specified, the program simply returns
- [ ] In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by an ’\n’ on the standard error

---

## Questions:

- Can I really have my subdirectories?
- How do I include libft and ft_printf?
