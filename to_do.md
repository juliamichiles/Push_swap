## To do:

- [ ] Missing ft_isnum and ft_strcmp in Libft
- [ ] Replace libft strjoin with piscine's strjoin
- [ ] Test validation
- [ ] Replace tokens_to_tab with tokens_to_stack (linked list)
- [ ] Redo validation (first, parse av to tokens, then validate each token)
- [ ] Take notes 
- [ ] Draft project structure (in detail)
- [X] Create pre-gitignore
- [X] Write main and input validation functions 
- [ ] Write 'rules' secction
- [X] Find out how to include libft + on the Makefile
- [X] Makefile
- [ ] Include ft_printf on repo + Makefile
- [ ] REPLACE 'write' with 'ft_printf'!!!!
- [X] Validation shouldn't allow repeated nums
---

## Take notes on:

- [X] Each operation
- [ ] Big O Notation
- [ ] Algorithm types
- [ ] More details on the chosen algorithm

---

## Final checks:

- [ ] Norm check
- [ ] Search unwanted files

---

## Rules
- [ ] Must have Makefile (it must not relink)
- [ ] The first argument should be at the top of the stack
- [ ] must display the shortest sequence of instructions needed to sort stack
      a with the smallest number at the top
- [ ] Instructions must be separated by a ’\n’ and nothing else
- [ ] If no parameters are specified, the program simply returns
- [ ] In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by an ’\n’ on the standard error

---

## Questions:

- Can I really have my subdirectories?
- How do I include libft and ft_printf?
